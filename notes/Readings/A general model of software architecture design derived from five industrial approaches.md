Better to read this section again than read notes on it

A mapping from [[A General Model Of Architecture Design]] to each of the 5 methods from section 2 exists in this section, and it is best used by looking at it (not reading notes of it)

The most important part to consider is that all of the methods have commonalities
- Emphasis on quality requirements
- Design elements organized into multiple views during
synthesis
- Iterative fine-grained evaluation activity as opposed to a coarse-grained (TODO: look into this)
