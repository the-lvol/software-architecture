# Project 1 Notes
- We should add a legend to the informal context diagram
- (We really need to look into our scenarios) Look into whether our scenarios are more functional requirements than a measure of a specific quality attribute
- And it's like, choose 3 attributes, and for each of these 3 attributes have 3 scenarios as an example, as the project description told us
