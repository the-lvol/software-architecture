# SA TODO
- Functional requirements vs quality attributes requirements [[Software Architecture in Practice - Book.pdf]] page 66
- Implementation, design, and architecture (from week 4 [[Architecture, design, implementation]])
  - Do a proper setup of intentional/extensional [[Intensional Abstraction]]
  - Do a proper setup of Locality/Non-locality [[Non-Local Abstraction]]
  - Configure all [[Architectural Pattern]] and [[Architectural Style]]s (maybe its [[Architectural View]]s?) according to [[Intension Locality Thesis]]


## Deliverable 2
- Idea (from another group): show all the styles in the overall section and explain tactics in each of the views
- Sequence diagram to explain the DNS resolving and/or the entire certificate requesting process
- We can easily apply a client-server style, but isn't that kinda redundant today? How would you even create an application without a client-server relationship?
- Add classes to the package diagram, to show some implementation details
- from the other groups, it seems like the component & connector view uses an object diagram. Though it still doesn't seem to fit https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams-overview.html#object-diagram
- We probably need to rename the Client Application to Certificate Maintainer Agent whatever
- Have external entities in the deployment diagram (Konstantinos mentioned to one of the groups)?
