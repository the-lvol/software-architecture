# Siemens Four Views (S4V)
- Developed by Siemens Corporate Research, the S4V method structures architectural design into four distinct views: conceptual, execution, module, and code architecture views.
- Each view addresses different engineering concerns, simplifying complex design tasks by separating concerns.

## Four Views:

### Conceptual View
- Maps product functionality to decomposable components and connectors.
- Focuses on fulfilling functional requirements, anticipating future enhancements, and addressing global properties like performance and dependability.
- Considers the system's relationship to product families, use of COTS, and domain-specific hardware/software.

### Module View
- Organizes modules into decomposition structures and layers to minimize dependencies, maximize reuse, and support testing.
- Aims to minimize future change impacts on COTS, software platforms, and domain-specific elements.

### Execution Architecture View
- Describes the system's runtime structure, including OS tasks, processes, and threads.
- Assigns system functionality to runtime elements, focusing on communication, resource allocation, and runtime properties (performance, safety, replication).


### Code Architecture View
- Organizes software artifacts into source and deployment components.
- Addresses product versioning, upgrade efforts, build time, and support for integration and testing.


## Global Analysis Activity:
- Involves identifying and analyzing **organizational**, **technological**, and **product factors** affecting architecture. (three factors)
- Architects explore key architectural issues and develop design strategies to address these challenges.
- Factors are assessed for conflict, priority, flexibility, stability, and impact on the system.
- Design strategies are proposed and applied to specific views, with ongoing evaluation for conflicts and interactions.
- Periodic architecture evaluations are conducted for cost prediction, risk assessment, and tradeoff analysis, informed by global analysis inputs like business drivers and quality attributes.

## Integration with Design Process:
- Global Analysis activities are interleaved with view design activities, allowing for iterative evaluation and adjustment.
- Emphasizes the importance of addressing both specific architectural concerns within each view and overarching challenges through global analysis.
