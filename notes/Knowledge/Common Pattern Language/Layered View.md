# Layered View
Objective: The Layered View conceptualizes the system as a composite of interacting parts, focusing on decomposition for clarity and modularity.

## Key Concerns:
- Identification and interaction of system parts.
- Decoupling components to enhance modifiability, scalability, and integrability.

## Implementation
- Components and Connectors: Components are designed to be as independent as possible, with connectors facilitating interaction through defined interfaces and protocols.
- Control Mechanism: An overarching control orchestrates component coordination, ensuring an organized scheme.

## Patterns and Their Roles

### LAYERS Pattern:
- Provides clear boundaries for work division.
- Utilizes EXPLICIT INTERFACE to maintain stability across layers, allowing internal modifications without affecting higher-level layers.
- Facilitates a client-server model between adjacent layers.
- Serves as a foundational structure for separating responsibilities.

## INDIRECTION LAYER Pattern:
- Acts as a mediator, hiding details of a component or subsystem and offering service access.
- Can be integrated into the subsystem or exist independently, serving functions like logging or additional task handling.
- Foundations for implementing patterns like REFLECTION, VIRTUAL MACHINE, and INTERCEPTER, by providing a layer that bridges higher-level instructions and platform-specific instructions.


## Architectural Applications
- Microkernel Architecture: Demonstrates a three-layered approach including external servers, the microkernel itself, and internal servers.
- Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC) Pattern: Enforces a hierarchical layered structure, from a top layer with a single agent to a bottom layer with leaf agents.
- Complexity Management: INDIRECTION LAYER enables managing complex interactions and functionalities, serving as a versatile component in various architectural patterns.

## Utility in Architectural Design
Versatility: The Layered View, through patterns like LAYERS and INDIRECTION LAYER, provides a robust framework for addressing complex system design concerns, ensuring scalability, modifiability, and integrability.

Interpattern Relationships: Demonstrates how layered architectures can incorporate and facilitate other architectural patterns, underscoring the interconnectedness and flexibility of design approaches within a software architecture.
