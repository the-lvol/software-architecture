# Distribution View
The Distribution View focuses on how components of a system, physically located across different network nodes or processes, interact and are structured to enhance interoperability, location transparency, performance, and modifiability.

## Key Concerns:
- Component Interaction: Mechanisms for communication among distributed components.
- Decoupling Distributed Components: Strategies to maintain independence between components across physical locations.
- Quality Attributes:
  - Interoperability: Ability of components to work together despite being distributed.
  - Location-Transparency: Making the physical location of components transparent to users and developers.
  - Performance: Ensuring efficient communication and processing across distributed components.
  - Modifiability: Facilitating easy changes and upgrades to the system without affecting distributed operations.

## Interaction Mechanisms:
- Components interact via connectors that facilitate the transfer of invocations or data, underpinning the systemâ€™s distributed architecture.

## Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs):
Utilize the Client-Server pattern, allowing clients to invoke server operations as if they were local, despite the potential for additional errors due to network issues or unimplemented operations.

## Message Queuing:
- Implements Client-Server interactions with Implicit Invocation as the primary method.
- Supports asynchronous communication, decoupling sending and receiving operations to enhance performance and reliability in distributed settings.
- Described extensively with a pattern language in messaging systems, providing a framework for understanding and implementing message-based interactions in a distributed environment.

## Error Handling:
Essential for managing the additional complexity and potential issues arising from remote invocations, such as network failures or the absence of required operations on the server.

## Decoupling and Quality Support:
- The Distribution View incorporates patterns and mechanisms like RPCs and Message Queuing to address the challenges of distributed systems.
- These approaches support decoupling by abstracting the complexity of distributed interactions and enhancing quality attributes essential for distributed system effectiveness.

This view articulates the structural and operational considerations for distributed systems, highlighting the importance of effective component interaction mechanisms, decoupling strategies, and supporting architectural patterns to achieve desired system qualities.
