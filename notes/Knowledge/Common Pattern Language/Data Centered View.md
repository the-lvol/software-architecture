# Data Centered View
TODO: the generated structure is a bit wonky. It would be worth doing some refactoring with the first application. More specifically the views and patterns are a bit messy

The Data-centered View emphasizes a system structured around a persistent, shared data store accessed and modified by various elements.

## Key Concerns:
- Data Store Management: Creation, access, and update mechanisms.
- Data Distribution: How data is spread across the system.
- Activity of Data Store: Determines if the data store is passive or active (notifies accessors or requires them to find data).
- Communication: Between the data store and accessing elements.
- Element Interaction: Whether accessors communicate through the shared data only or also directly.
- Quality Attributes: Focus on scalability, modifiability, reusability, and integrability.

## Components and Connectors:
- Data Store: Independent and possibly multiple.
- Accessing Elements: Components are usually independent of each other.
- Connectors: Facilitate data transfer between data stores and accessors.

## [[Shared Repository]] Services:
- Might include security, query languages, or tuple spaces for enhanced access.

## Architectural Alternatives:
- Serves as an alternative to sequential architectures like layers pipes and filters.
- Can be integrated into a pipes and filters architecture for data sharing.
- Functions as a client-server model with the data store as the server.
- Comparable to a two-layer system with the [[Shared Repository]] at the lower level.

## Pattern Variants:
- Active Repository Pattern: Utilizes explicit or implicit invocations (e.g., publish-subscribe) for notifications.
- Blackboard Pattern: Suitable for immature domains lacking deterministic solutions, with a control component that could be integrated into clients or the blackboard.

This view facilitates an understanding of how shared data repositories impact system architecture, emphasizing data management, component interaction, and architectural flexibility.
