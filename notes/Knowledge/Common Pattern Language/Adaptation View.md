# Adaptation View
The Adaptation View focuses on segregating a system into a core, an invariable part and an adaptable part to facilitate evolution over time or across different system versions.

## Key Concerns:
- System Adaptability: Enhancing the system's ability to evolve or accommodate multiple versions.
- Change Prone vs. Invariable Functionality: Identifying components likely to change versus those that will remain constant.
- Communication: Between invariable and adaptable components.
- Quality Attributes: Ensuring modifiability, reusability, evolvability, and integrability.

## Components and Communication:
- Invariable Components: Core parts that remain unchanged.
- Adaptable Components (Variation Points): Parts that can change over time or per version.
- Connectors with clear interfaces facilitate communication, with some connectors also serving as adaptable variation points.

## Microkernel Pattern:
- Promotes flexibility for adapting to changing requirements.
- Structured in layers, from a low-level system abstraction to higher-level service integration.
- Serves as an indirection layer, abstracting system details from application logic.

## Alternatives and Extensions:
- Interpreter and Virtual Machine: Offer component integration and extension capabilities, similar to Microkernel.
- Can be combined with Microkernel for a comprehensive plug-and-play component environment.

## Client-Server and Distributed Architectures:
- Microkernel mediates communication between clients and servers, enhancing security and modifiability.
- Combining Microkernel with the Broker pattern can hide communication details in distributed settings.

## Plug-and-Play Component Support:
- Reflection: Enables dynamic composition and reconfiguration of components.
- Organized in layers, with meta-objects in the meta-layer and application logic in the base layer. 
- Note, that sometimes meta-objects require access to the application logic, which breaks the definition of a [[Layered Pattern]]

## Interceptor Pattern for Adaptable Frameworks:
- Can be implemented using an Indirection Layer, Interpreter, or Virtual Machine.
- Allows for dynamic event processing and supports aspect-oriented and middleware architectures.

This view outlines strategies for building systems that can adapt to future changes and versions, emphasizing the importance of clear component interfaces, patterns for flexibility, and techniques for dynamic component management and communication.
