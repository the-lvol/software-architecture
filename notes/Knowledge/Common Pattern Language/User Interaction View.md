# User Interaction View
The User Interaction View separates the system into user interface (UI) components and application logic, focusing on their interaction and the presentation of data to the user.

Key Concerns:
- Data and Application Logic Association: Understanding the connection between UI and the underlying application logic.
- Decoupling UI from Application Logic: Strategies for maintaining a separation that enhances usability, modifiability, and reusability.
- Support for Quality Attributes: Ensuring the system is user-friendly, easy to modify, and components are reusable.

## Component Interaction:
- Components: Implement UI presentation, user input handling, and application logic.
- Connectors: Facilitate data exchange between components, typically through message-based change notification mechanisms.

## Architectural Patterns:
- Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates application logic (Model) from UI (View) and input handling (Controller). Utilizes Publish-Subscribe for updating Views and Controllers based on Model changes.
- Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC): An extension of MVC, where each agent follows the MVC structure. Organized in layers (see [[Layered Pattern]]), from chief agents controlling the application to fine-grained agents handling specific user interactions. Changes are propagated using Publish-Subscribe.
- C2 Architectural Pattern: Suited for applications with extensive UI requirements, featuring multiple components and connectors across layers for decoupled interaction and flexibility.

## Key Patterns and Mechanisms:
- Publish-Subscribe: Central to MVC and PAC for notifying changes across components.
- Layered Structure: PAC, defines different levels of agent responsibility from top-level application control to lower-level specific services.

## Alternative Patterns:
- C2 Architectural Pattern: Offers an alternative approach to managing complex UIs and application logic, emphasizing decoupled, layered interactions for enhanced modifiability and reusability.

This view emphasizes the importance of clear separation and structured interaction between UI components and application logic, employing patterns like MVC, PAC, and C2 to support system usability, flexibility, and component reuse.
