# Component Interaction View
The Component Interaction View focuses on the interaction among independent components within a system, emphasizing decoupling and supporting modifiability and integrability.

## Key Concerns:
- Component Interaction: Mechanisms for independent components to interact without direct control over each other.
- Decoupling Components: Strategies to maintain component independence while facilitating interaction.
- Quality Attributes: Enhancing modifiability and integrability through architectural patterns.

## Interaction Mechanisms:
Components exchange data via connectors, either synchronously or asynchronously, through message-based communication or direct calls.

## Explicit vs. Implicit Invocation:
- Explicit Invocation: Direct, potentially synchronous or asynchronous, calls between components, facilitated by patterns like Broker and Proxy.
  - Synchronous: The client waits for the result.
  - Asynchronous: The client proceeds without waiting, with patterns like Fire and Forget, Sync with Server, Poll Object, and Result Callback handling result delivery.
    - The FIRE AND FORGET pattern describes best-effort delivery semantics for asynchronous operations but does not convey results or acknowledgments.
    - The SYNC WITH SERVER pattern describes invocation semantics for sending an acknowledgment back to the client once the operation arrives on the server side, but the pattern does not convey results.
    - The POLL OBJECT pattern describes invocation semantics that allow clients to poll (query) for the results of asynchronous invocations, for instance, in certain intervals.
    - The RESULT CALLBACK pattern also describes invocation semantics that allow the client to receive results; in contrast to POLL OBJECT, however, it actively notifies the requesting client of asynchronously arriving results rather than waiting for the client to poll for them
- Implicit Invocation: Components react to events or changes without direct calls, supporting dynamic addition/removal of components.
Often asynchronous, decoupling event producers from consumers.

## Architectural Patterns:
- Broker Pattern: Manages distributed system communications, decoupling components from the communication infrastructure.
- Publish-Subscribe: Decouples producers and consumers, allowing for dynamic event-based communication.
- Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer: Facilitate explicit invocations with varying degrees of complexity and distribution challenges.
- Model-View-Controller (MVC): Splits application logic, UI, and input handling, utilizing implicit invocations for component interaction.
- Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC): Extends MVC to hierarchical agent-based systems, promoting decoupling through event-based communication.

## Client-Server Architectures:
- Support complex interactions and distributed systems, often using Brokers to manage communication complexity.
- Can be designed in n-tier architectures, including 3-tier systems (client, application logic, and backend tiers).

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P):
- Enables decentralized component discovery and interaction, often using Lookup patterns for initial connections.
Publish-Subscribe in Distributed Systems:
- Supports asynchronous event handling and integration, applicable in various contexts from GUI frameworks to database consistency.

## Challenges and Solutions:
- Asynchronous invocations require careful handling to align results with invocations, using mechanisms like Asynchronous Completion Tokens.
- Publish-Subscribe offers strong decoupling but introduces complexity in event registration and data exchange.

This view presents a framework for understanding how components interact within a system, utilizing a mix of explicit and implicit invocations, supported by a variety of architectural patterns to ensure decoupling, modifiability, and integrability.
