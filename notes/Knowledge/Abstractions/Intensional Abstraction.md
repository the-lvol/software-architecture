# Intensional Abstraction
    A specification is considered intensional if it can have an unbounded number of instances, meaning there are infinitely many possible instances of the specification. Conversely, specifications that do not meet this criterion are considered extensional.

- Intensional Specifications: Defined by constraints that specify the necessary properties at the architectural level, supporting the "principle of least constraint." They define a concept through a set of constraints rather than enumerating its instances. For example, a prime number is defined by its divisibility properties, not by listing prime numbers.
- Extensional Specifications: Define sets by explicitly listing their members. An example is the definition of NATO members by listing countries like the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, etc.
- Architectural Specifications: This must be intensional, constraining only what is necessary at the architectural system description level.

## Definition of Intensionality in Specifications:
Implication: Intensional specifications can be satisfied by infinitely many design models and, by extension, by infinitely many programs.

## Significance for Software Architecture:
This distinction emphasizes flexibility and generality in architectural specifications, allowing for a broad range of implementations that adhere to the core architectural principles without being overly prescriptive.
