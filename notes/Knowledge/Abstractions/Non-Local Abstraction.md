# Non-Local Abstraction
    Article: We say that a specification φ is local if and only if the following condition holds: 
    If φ is satisfied in some design model m then it is satisfied by every design model that subsumes m. 

    GPT: A specification is local if it is satisfied by a design model and by every design model that subsumes it. This means that if a specification applies in any part of a program, it must apply throughout all of its extensions.

- Architectural vs. Design Specifications: Architectural specifications differ from design specifications in that they must apply to the entire system. This is known as the Locality criterion, indicating that such specifications are relevant across all extensions of the program.

## Subsumes
    Informally, we say that design model n subsumes m if m is a “sub-model” of n

## Example of Locality
Universal Base Class in C++: A rule where every class inherits, directly or indirectly, from a single "Object" class. This is an architectural property because it is both intensional (applicable in a broad, non-specific manner) and pervasive (applies across the entire system).

## Subsumption and Locality:
Subsumption: The concept where one design model can be considered an extension or "super-model" of another, akin to strict inheritance in programming.

## Implications for Software Architecture:
- The [[Intension Locality Thesis]]: Argues that properties like the Universal Base Class are architectural due to their pervasiveness and intentionality.
- Criteria Application: These criteria help distinguish between architectural specifications, which govern the structure and principles of the entire system, and design specifications, which may apply to more localized parts of a system.
