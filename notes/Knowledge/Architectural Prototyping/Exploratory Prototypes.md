# Exploratory Prototypes 
    Used to clarify requirements to the architecture together with its stakeholders, explore aspects of the target system, and discuss alternative architectural solutions

- **Purpose**: Focus on basic issues, questions, or critical problems of architecture to facilitate communication and learning among stakeholders (architects, customers, users, developers).
- **Usage Context**: Early stages of software development with high uncertainty about how to build the target system.
- **Approach**:
  - Practical demonstration of executable prototypes to discuss pros and cons, grounded in real code rather than speculations.
  - Build and compare multiple alternative prototypes to explore different architectural styles or solutions.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Facilitates exploring the pros and cons of different architectural styles, helping architects think beyond usual patterns.
  - Investigate architectural qualities like buildability and conceptual integrity through early, overall architectural prototypes.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Alternative exploratory prototypes are evaluated based on how they meet the core quality requirements of the target system, typically by the system's stakeholders.
  - Ground discussions in "real code" to learn and reduce risk (e.g., integration with legacy data in the Dragon case).
- **Refinement**:
  - Once an architectural style is chosen, it can be refined by exploring different architectural features (components, connectors, topology) and how they influence the target system.
  - Investigate different strategies in implementation, such as architecture or design patterns, to meet the required qualities for an architecture.
