# Architectural Pattern
In this course Architectural Pattern == Architectural Styles (though, it is not like this in the real world)

**Definition**: Defines element types and relationships to solve specific problems, acting as a specialized [[Viewpoint]] with additional semantics and constraints.

- Purpose: Architectural patterns offer pre-designed solutions to recurring problems in software systems. They consist of established arrangements of architectural elements.

- Benefits:
  - Time-tested strategies: These patterns have proven effective across various domains.
  - Packaged knowledge: They simplify design by providing reusable blueprints.

- What's inside a pattern:
  - Element types: The specific building blocks involved in the pattern.
  - Interaction forms: How these elements communicate or work together.

## Architectural Patterns And [[Architectural Style]]s Differences
- Patterns: Viewed as problem-solution pairs within specific contexts, emphasizing the rationale behind solutions and the forces shaping problems. Patterns are part of a pattern language with interdependencies and must be non-obvious, commonly practiced, and provide aesthetic solutions.
- Styles: Focus on components, connectors, and configurations rather than the problem or rationale. Styles are more concrete, with specific constraints and the potential for multiple variations to address specialized design problems. Architecture Description Languages can support individual styles.

## Granularity and Cataloging Issues
Granularity: Ambiguity in differentiating between architectural and [[Design Pattern]]s. The perspective of the designer/architect plays a role in categorization.

Cataloging: No unified catalog exists; literature is vast and diverse. Previous attempts at classification exist but lack consensus, making it difficult to establish a standardized scheme.
