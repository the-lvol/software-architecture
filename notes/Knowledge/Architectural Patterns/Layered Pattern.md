# Layered Pattern
- A Layered pattern enforces a unidirectional use relationship between software elements, forming distinct layers of functionality.
- Each layer can only use services from the layer directly below it, promoting modularity and maintainability.
- Variations exist in practice, but the core principle remains.
- Layers often act as abstractions, hiding implementation details and enabling portability.
