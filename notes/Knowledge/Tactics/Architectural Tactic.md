# Architectural Tactic
    Architectural tactics are design decisions aimed at achieving desired responses for specific quality attributes in a system. Unlike architectural patterns, which encapsulate trade-offs, tactics focus singularly on enhancing one quality attribute without considering trade-offs.

## Key Points:

### Purpose of Architectural Tactics:
- Tactics are used to directly influence a system's response to stimuli, thereby realizing business goals through specified quality attribute responses.

### Focus and Trade-offs:
- Each tactic targets a single quality attribute. Trade-offs between different quality attributes are managed separately by the architect, not within the tactic itself.

### Difference from Architectural Patterns:
- Unlike patterns, tactics do not inherently include trade-offs but are focused actions to achieve a specific quality attribute response.

### Application and Significance:
- Tactics allow architects to tailor designs to achieve specific quality goals, providing a toolkit for augmenting existing patterns or creating new designs from foundational principles.

### Reasons for Cataloging Tactics:
- Simplify the application of complex design patterns.
- Enable construction of design solutions when no existing pattern fits the architect's goals.
- Systematize the design process within certain constraints, acknowledging that tactics may overlap and require careful selection based on trade-offs and implementation costs.

### Refinement and Context-Dependence:
- Tactics often need refinement (e.g., specific scheduling strategies for performance) and vary in applicability based on the system context (e.g., managing sampling rate in real-time systems).
