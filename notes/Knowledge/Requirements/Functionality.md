# Functionality
    Functionality is the ability of the system to do the work for which it was intended

## [[Requirement]]
- Functionality alone doesn't dictate architecture: Many possible architectures can address the same set of functional requirements.
- Architecture serves goals beyond functionality: Systems are divided into elements to aid understanding, development, and other quality attributes (e.g., maintainability, scalability).
- Functionality still requires structure: Tasks must be assigned to architectural elements to deliver functionality.
- Architecture guides how tasks are assigned: When quality attributes are important, the division of tasks may be limited to meet those goals (e.g., separate modules for teamwork).

Main Idea:  While not the only driver, functionality interacts with various quality attributes when shaping software architecture
