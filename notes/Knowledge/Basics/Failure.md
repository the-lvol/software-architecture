# Failure
    A failure in a system occurs when the service provided no longer aligns with its specified requirements, which is noticeable to the system's users or actors.

Faults, either singly or in combination, have the potential to cause failures. The goal of availability tactics is to prevent these faults from disrupting the service according to its specifications.
